# System Architecture & Design Decisions

## 1. File Structure Overview
The project is divided into a clear `frontend` and `backend` separation to ensure modularity and ease of deployment.

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- **`/src/components`**: Contains reusable UI components (Atomic design-ish). 
    - `Editor.tsx`: The core Lexical implementation.
    - `plugins/`: Custom Lexical plugins like the `ToolbarPlugin`.
- **`/src/hooks`**: Custom React hooks for business logic.
    - `useAutoSave.ts`: Encapsulates the debounce logic for API syncing.
- **`/src/store`**: State management using Zustand.
    - `useEditorStore.tsx`: Centralized source of truth for the current post.
    - `authStore.ts`: Handles JWT and user session state.
- **`/src/utils`**: Global utilities like the Axios interceptor (`api.ts`).

### Backend (`/backend`)
- **`main.py`**: A single-file FastAPI entry point (suitable for the assignment scale) containing routes, dependency injection for auth, and database logic.

## 2. Technical Choices & Justification

### State Management: Zustand
- **Why?** Zustand was chosen over Redux for its boilerplate-free API and high performance with React's concurrent features. It allows the Editor state to be synced with the Header's "Saving" status without complex prop drilling.

### Editor Framework: Lexical
- **Why?** Unlike simple textareas, Lexical provides a robust "state-to-JSON" serialization that is production-ready. We store the content as a `SerializedEditorState` (JSON) in MongoDB to preserve rich formatting and nested nodes without data loss.

### Database: MongoDB (Motor)
- **Why?** Since blog posts are document-based and Lexical outputs JSON, a NoSQL database like MongoDB is a natural fit. The `motor` library provides asynchronous drivers for FastAPI, ensuring the API doesn't block during heavy I/O operations.
